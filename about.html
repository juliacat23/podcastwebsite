        <p>This website serves as supporting material for my entry in the March 2021 ORISE Mental Health Awareness: Undergraduate Challenge. The following is an excerpt from the Oak Ridge Institue for Science and Education (ORISE) website on their March 2021 STEM Scholarship opportunity. </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://orise.orau.gov/resources/stem/scholarships.html">
          Prior to COVID-19, college students were already experiencing a mental health crisis. In October 2020, a survey of college students found that 63% of students say that their emotional health is worse than before the COVID-19 pandemic and 56% of students are significantly concerned with their ability to care for their mental health. Furthermore, it was found that a high proportion of students are dealing with anxiety (82%), followed by social isolation/loneliness (68%), depression (63%), trouble concentrating (62%), and difficulty coping with stress in a healthy way (60%). One in five (19%) students have had suicidal thoughts in the past month.

        <blockquote cite="https://orise.orau.gov/resources/stem/scholarships.html">
          Choose an activity that you can do for 21 days to better your mental health. Examples of activities are the following: journaling, exercising, sleeping eight hours, etc. Perform background research to learn more about this activity; how to best integrate it into your life; what types of problems it may help with; any other relevant information. Collect data on your personal experience and mental wellbeing over 21 days. Develop an infographic or podcast to communicate your research and results. Depending on your data, promote or discourage the activity to other students. If discouraged, provide a researched alternative activity and reasoning. The submission should include research on how the activity betters oneâ€™s mental health, as well as personal data collected during your habit creating process. You must provide supporting evidence, using a supporting document for citations and additional information.

        <p>I chose to study the benefits of limiting my social media use and how it affected my mental health. Furthermore, I decided to communicate my findings through a podcast since I believe a podcast will be most accessible to college students.</p>
        <p>Further explanation of the concepts behind the podcast's experiment and creation are detailed in the Supporting Document.
