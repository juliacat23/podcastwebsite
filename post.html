          <p>Hello Everyone! Welcome back to another episode of "Not Your Average Podcast"! A podcast for college students. By college students. Today we will be exploring how to manage your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

          <p>For those living in the United States, we recently passed the one-year anniversary of the COVID-19 lockdown. For most of us, we went from having in-person classes and eating lunches with our friends in the student union to having to move back home and take completely virtual courses in the blink of an eye. While these public health measures are absolutely essential in the fight against COVID-19, they adversely affect one's mental health. This is not an unknown or new phenomenon either! </p>

          <p>Natural disasters, wars, and epidemics are known elicitors of poor mental health. In a study conducted by Jalloh et al., researchers discovered elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in survivors of the 2014 - 2016 west Africa Ebola epidemic<sup>[1]</sup>. Those who lived in areas with a high concentration of Ebola cases displayed the highest prevalence of anxiety symptoms<sup>[1]</sup>. In a well-documented study by DiGiovanni et al., researchers identified a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms in those quarantined during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in Canada<sup>[2]</sup>. Their research demonstrated the psychological stress imposed by public health quarantine orders<sup>[2]</sup>. Their findings were later collaborated by several publications emerging in early 2020 regarding the city-wide lockdown in Wahun, China<sup>[3]</sup>. Quarantine has an apparent adverse effect on one's mental health. </p>

          <p>Specifically, the social isolation caused by quarantine has the most negative effect on mental health. This effect is amplified in adolescents and young adults. The ages between 15 and 24 represent a crucial stage in social development<sup>[4]</sup>.  During this period, an individual's social interactions dramatically contribute to the social brain network's development<sup>[4]</sup>. Furthermore, adolescents and young adults are hypersensitive to perceived social rejections<sup>[5]</sup>. Social rejection and isolation are directly correlated with an elevated risk of risky behavior and substance use<sup>[4]</sup>. Conversely, healthy social interactions serve as protective factors against mental illnesses<sup>[4]</sup>.</p>

          <p>As students grapple with the social isolation imposed by mass quarantine public health orders, they increasingly turn to social media to facilitate connections. While moderate social media use is not unhealthy and provides some health benefits, excessive social media use is detrimental to one's mental health<sup>[6]</sup>. Excessive social media use is a known contributor to decreased psychological wellbeing and self-esteem [6]. Social media use also induces feelings of judgment and FOMO, or fear of missing out, in individuals<sup>[7]</sup>. In a pandemic when individuals cannot see their friends, feelings of FOMO will be heightened. This concept is often referred to as "Facebook envy," or the notion that increased social media use results in more negative feelings towards oneself<sup>[8]</sup>. In a 2017 study by Tandoc et al., increased Facebook use was an accurate predictor of future depressive symptoms<sup>[8]</sup>. </p>

          <p>I decided to limit my social media for 21 days to observe how it affected my mental health and wellbeing. Using the built-in Apple screentime app, I recorded my daily social media usage. Before the 21 days, I took three assessments, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised. Additionally, I completed a high-frequency mood assessment daily to track sudden mood changes. The high-frequency mood assessment recorded daily instances of anxiety, depression, concentration, and loneliness. After 21 days, I completed the three evaluations again. </p>

          <p>At first, I found myself feeling jittery and "off" at the notion of limiting my social media time. I would find myself instinctively opening my phone to open various social media apps. To counteract this, I rearranged the placement of the apps on my phone screen. This required me to put more conscious effort into actually opening the app, and I was usually able to stop myself before doing so. </p>

          <p>After a few days, I started to feel the noticeable effects of decreased social media use. I was able to concentrate more, and I didn't feel as jealous of people who were socializing with their friends while I could not. I experienced less anxiety and had overall fewer periods of sadness and hopelessness.  When I slipped up and unknowingly increased my social media use, I felt the adverse effects more intensely. Specifically, I experienced heightened feelings of sadness and loneliness.  </p>

          <p>Statistical analysis of the assessments conducted during the experiment also highlighted the effect of social media on mood. Increased social media use was significantly correlated with decreased psychological wellbeing. For a more in-depth analysis of the results obtained from the assessments, please read the Supporting Document pdf on <a href="https://github.com/juliacat23/pandemic-mental-health">github.com/juliacat23/pandemic-mental-health.</a> </p>

          <p>Even though excessive social media use is detrimental to one's psychological wellbeing, it is important to note that moderate use can be beneficial. When it can be hard to form social connections because of the pandemic, reasonable social media use allows us to remain connected with friends and family.</p>
